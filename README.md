## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- In this project I kept on training the React hooks like useState and also used React's custom hooks.

- For styling, I've had a great time using the power of SCSS Mixins. This is really powerful and makes you write less re-usable code.
